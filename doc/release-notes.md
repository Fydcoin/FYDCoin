Mandatory Update
==============


How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/FydCoin-Qt (on Mac) or fydd/fyd-qt (on Linux).


Compatibility
==============

FydCoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows 7 and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support), No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues. Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

FydCoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not frequently tested on them.
